# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest commit on `main` is supported. Fixes land there; there are no backport
branches and no maintained older releases.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately through GitHub: open the **Security** tab of
<https://github.com/winniesi/dsh-commandcode-quota> and choose **Report a
vulnerability**. If that channel is not available to you, open a normal issue that
says only that you have a security report and how to reach you — put no details in
the issue itself.

Say what you ran, what happened, and what you expected; a minimal reproduction is
worth more than a long description. This is a personal project maintained in spare
time, so expect an acknowledgement within a few days, and please hold public
disclosure until a fix is out.

## What this plugin does with your machine

| | |
|---|---|
| **Reads** | Your DSH config — the provider routes in `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` or a patch layer (`$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>/cordis.patch.yml`), and `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` for credential references — plus the official CLI's login state at `~/.commandcode/auth.json`, and the credential environment variables listed below. Nothing else. |
| **Writes** | One file: the last-report snapshot at `$DSH_HOME/dsh-commandcode-quota/last-report.json` (directory `0700`, file `0600`). It holds the figures the card shows and a short, non-reversible digest of the key, so the plugin can tell whether the snapshot belongs to the account currently configured. The key itself is never in it. Delete the file any time; the plugin recreates it. |
| **Sends** | HTTPS to `https://api.commandcode.ai` with **your own** key. No other host appears in the code. |
| **Collects** | Nothing. No telemetry, no analytics, no error reporting, no identifiers. |
| **Install** | Runs nothing. No `postinstall` script, no downloaded code, no remote configuration. |

The API calls are four read-only GETs, all with your key: `/alpha/whoami`
(account name, org id), `/alpha/usage/summary` (credits used this period,
requests, tokens), `/alpha/billing/credits` (remaining credits, the 5-hour and
weekly windows) and `/alpha/billing/subscriptions` (plan id, billing period).
There is no other request and no public endpoint is read. Each endpoint degrades
on its own: a failure is recorded in the report and shown on the card instead of
being retried silently.

### Host config

This plugin does **not** write any host config. It installs through DSH's own
plugin mechanism — `dsh plugin --profile web add …`, with the bundle patch at the
repository root registering the loader row — so the only thing that touches your
profile is the host itself. To remove it, `dsh plugin --profile web remove
dsh-commandcode-quota`; to clear the cached snapshot too, delete
`$DSH_HOME/dsh-commandcode-quota/`.

### The browser half

The card runs inside the host's renderer, so a bug here is a bug in a trusted
context. The client touches the DOM for exactly two things: injecting one
stylesheet keyed `.ccq-`, and rendering the card. It sends no request of its own —
it asks the host over the same-origin `/api` transport (fenced to loopback,
browser-session cookie required), and the host makes the upstream call. No
`localStorage`, no cookies, no direct network calls. Report anything that lets a
server response reach the DOM as markup rather than as text.

### Credentials

Your Command Code key is discovered in this order, and used for nothing except the
`Authorization` header of the four requests above:

1. An explicitly passed key — the CLI's `--key`.
2. **Discovered from your own DSH configuration**: any provider route whose
   `baseURL` points at `commandcode.ai`, read from `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` or a
   patch layer (`$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>/cordis.patch.yml`
   — the desktop app keeps its settings there). The plugin reads that route's literal
   `apiKey`, or its `apiKeyEnv` resolved through the environment and
   `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`.
3. Environment variables `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`, `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY`,
   `CMD_API_KEY`, then any variable whose name contains `commandcode`.
4. The same names inside `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (`refs.<NAME>`).
5. `~/.commandcode/auth.json`, the official `command-code` CLI's login state.

A key is never written to a log, to the cache, or into anything the plugin
renders — the browser only ever receives the normalized report. Prefer the
environment variable over a literal in a config file that might get committed. If
you believe a key of yours is exposed, revoke it in your Command Code account
first — that is the only step that actually helps.

## Scope

In scope: anything in this repository that leaks a credential, sends data anywhere
other than `https://api.commandcode.ai`, writes outside the paths listed here, or
turns an untrusted input (a settings file, an API response, a config value) into
code execution.

Out of scope: the Command Code API itself; DeepSeek Harness and its plugin
mechanism; and anything that requires an attacker who already holds your key or
your shell.

## Requirements

The plugin requires `dsh >= 0.1.5-rc.1` and the **web** profile. On an older host
the plugin does not load, which is the intended failure — better a plugin that
refuses than a card that renders nothing.
