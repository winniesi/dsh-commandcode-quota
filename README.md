# Command Code quota for DeepSeek Harness

**Your 5-hour, weekly and monthly credit windows, in the sidebar — right above Settings.**

No browser tab, no login, no guessing how much of the plan is left.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **One row, then the rest** | Resting, the card is the monthly allowance alone — the number that decides whether the month still works; the first click unfolds the 5-hour and weekly windows (shortest first), the second the money and totals |
| **Percentage first** | The headline rounds to a whole percent, exactly like the Command Code dashboard, so the card and the website never disagree |
| **Money where it matters** | Used and remaining for the monthly allowance; exact figures for every row on hover |
| **Instant, then live** | The card is on screen about 2 ms after a restart, and live about a second later |
| **Quiet when it should be** | No Command Code account? The card does not render at all |
| **Chinese, one size** | Every word on the card is Chinese whatever language DSH runs in, and every line — title, label, number — is set at the same size |

Everything is read from **your own account's data** — window count, caps and percentages come from the API, never assumed. GOAT, Pro, Provider, Max and Teams work; a plan that reports no rolling windows simply renders no rows. (The $1 **Go** tier is the exception — it has no API access, so the card has nothing to render there.)

## Check your dsh version first

**This plugin needs dsh `^0.1.5-rc.1`.** On anything older it crashes at startup:

```
Error: failed to apply loader entry commandcode-quota:
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'register')
```

The `ctx.connection.fetch` seam it relies on does not exist in older releases. Check before you install:

```sh
dsh --version          # needs 0.1.5-rc.1 or newer
npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest
```

Note that the plugin's 156 offline checks also **pass** on an older dsh — they never start dsh. So "the checks are green" does not mean it will work once installed.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Jovan1666/dsh-commandcode-quota
```

Then restart `dsh web` and reload the browser page. That is the whole setup — no configuration file, no API key to paste: if Command Code is already a provider in your DSH settings, the plugin finds it.

The package declares a bundle patch (`dsh.bundle.patch` → its `cordis.patch.yml`), so `dsh plugin add` registers the plugin row for you. **Do not also append that row to your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`.** Two layers inserting the same loader id make dsh refuse to start: `duplicate loader entry id: commandcode-quota`. The row belongs to the manual install below, where no bundle layer exists.

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install, and how to remove it</summary>

**From a local clone**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jovan1666/dsh-commandcode-quota
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-commandcode-quota
```

**Manually, without pnpm** — link the folder into the profile's `node_modules`, then register the row yourself, since nothing else will:

```yaml
# $DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml
- insert:
    - id: commandcode-quota
      name: "dsh-commandcode-quota"
```

A freshly created profile ends that file with `[]`. **Replace the `[]`** — appending a sequence under it is not valid YAML, and the profile will not load.

```sh
# macOS / Linux  ($DSH_HOME defaults to $HOME/.dsh)
ln -s "$PWD/dsh-commandcode-quota" "${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-commandcode-quota"
```

```powershell
# Windows  ($env:DSH_HOME defaults to $env:USERPROFILE\.dsh)
$dsh = if ($env:DSH_HOME) { $env:DSH_HOME } else { "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh" }
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$dsh\profiles\web\node_modules\dsh-commandcode-quota" -Target "$PWD\dsh-commandcode-quota"
```

**To remove it:** `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-commandcode-quota` drops the package and the bundle layer that registers it; a manual install instead deletes the `cordis.patch.yml` row. Restart `dsh web` either way. To clear the cached snapshot too, delete `$DSH_HOME/dsh-commandcode-quota/`.

</details>

## Why it appears before you look

The card used to wait out a full upstream round trip before drawing anything, and a restarted dsh has nothing cached — which is exactly the "it takes a moment to show up" feeling. Measured against the live API with `node preview/latency.mjs`:

| | |
|---|---|
| First answer after a restart, snapshot on disk | **~2 ms** |
| First answer after a restart, no snapshot yet | ~1.4 s |
| The four endpoints requested one after another | ~2.3 s |
| The four endpoints requested together | ~1.2 s |

Two things make the difference:

1. **All four endpoints are requested at once.** `whoami` used to be awaited on its own — about 590 ms of pure waiting, to learn an org id that personal accounts never report.
2. **The last good report is kept on disk.** A cold start answers with it immediately — dimmed, with how old it is on the tooltip — while a live read runs behind it. The card re-asks 3 seconds later instead of waiting out the usual minute, so the numbers are live by the time you have read them.

## How to read the card

| Window | What it means | On GOAT |
|---|---|---|
| **5-hour** | Rolling burst limit — one long session cannot drain the month | `$14` |
| **Weekly** | Rolling 7-day limit | `$35` |
| **Monthly** | The billing period's credit allowance | `$70` |

Each row shows the **used percentage** (green below 60 %, amber below 85 %, red above), a meter in the same colour, and a **reset countdown** (`59m`, `6d9h`, `8d1h`).

The card rests on one row — the monthly allowance — because that is the figure a budget holder actually checks. **Click it once** and the 5-hour and weekly windows unfold beside it; **click it again** for the monthly allowance in money, the remaining credit, the request count and the token totals; a third click folds it back. Every window's figures stay on the card's tooltip even while it is folded, so nothing needs a click to be readable. Collapse the sidebar and the card becomes a 36 px badge showing the **most constrained** window.

### Reading the numbers

- Percentages are `used ÷ (used + remaining)`, read live from the API. `preview/e2e-live.mjs` asserts that identity against a real account on demand.
- The headline rounds to a whole percent, the same way the dashboard does. That is why the website can say `100%` while the exact share is `99.84%` — same data, two roundings. The exact figure and the money are one hover away.
- The monthly cap is the sum of two figures from two different endpoints. Across a billing-period rollover or a plan change those two can describe different periods, and the sum would look plausible while being wrong by tens of percent. The plan's nominal allowance is the sanity check; when a read fails it, the host reports **no percentage at all** and the card says why. The next refresh corrects it.

### What the card deliberately leaves out

The sidebar is about 200 px of content width, and a laptop screen makes small type smaller still. So the card answers one question well — *how deep am I?* — instead of laying out everything the API returns:

- **One type size, and no status line when the numbers are old.** The title, the window labels, the percentage and the notes are all set at 13 px: a 14 px headline over 12 px notes made one small card read as two stacked documents. A stale reading dims the card instead of printing "last success 3m ago" underneath it — the dimming already says the numbers are not live, and the exact age is on the tooltip.
- **Folded until asked.** The seat is permanent and shared with Settings, so the resting card spends its single row on the monthly allowance instead of three rows nobody asked for. The rolling windows, the money and the totals are each one click away, and warnings — a canceled subscription, a below-threshold balance — stay on screen at every stage rather than waiting behind one.
- **Money only for the monthly allowance.** The 5-hour and weekly windows are pass/fail gates, not budgets; their dollar rows told a user nothing they could act on. Hover still shows exact figures.
- **No pace verdict, no burn-rate forecast.** "Over pace" cannot be acted on by someone who has work to do, and a projected exhaustion date assumes a constant burn rate that credit usage never has. The host still exposes `projection` in its JSON for scripts.
- **Nothing silent.** A row that disappears because its endpoint failed says so; a failure with nothing to fall back on says what went wrong in one readable line, with the full diagnostic text on hover.

## The `/quota` command

Type `/quota` in a conversation to print the same report as text:

```text
Command Code · GOAT (active)
5-hour 1.4% used · resets in 3h17m
Weekly 12.8% used · resets in 6d7h
Monthly 99.8% used · $70.11 / $70.23 · $0.11 left · resets in 7d22h
18,087 requests · 100% success · in 3.49B / out 16.77M
```

It reads the same cached report the card does, so a slash invocation costs no extra upstream requests — and unlike the card, it never answers from a stale snapshot: typing a command means asking for the current numbers. Its text is English; the card is Chinese.

## Requirements

- **DeepSeek Harness** `^0.1.5-rc.1`. The plugin uses framework seams that are not a stable public API yet; see [Compatibility](#compatibility).
- The **web** profile. The card mounts into the browser sidebar through the `connection` service, which only the web app composes — a headless or CLI profile has nowhere to put it.
- A **Command Code** account with API access. Every plan except the `$1` **Go** tier includes it; see [Getting a Command Code plan](#getting-a-command-code-plan).
- Node.js 18+ — only for the optional CLI and the development scripts.

## Getting a Command Code plan

The card reads any Command Code plan that has API access. This plugin was built against **GOAT**: `$10/month`, which buys `$70` of credits, gated at `$14` per 5-hour window and `$35` per rolling week.

GOAT is the tier that suits an agent harness. Command Code's own estimate for **DeepSeek V4 Flash** on that allowance is **~154,000 requests a month** (~30,800 per 5-hour window, ~76,900 per week), because flash-tier models bill at roughly `$0.15` input / `$0.60` output per million tokens with cache reads at `$0.003`. A coding agent spends its budget on exactly those calls: many small turns, most of the context re-read from cache. Tens of thousands of tool-calling turns a month is ordinary work, and at that price the window caps and the monthly allowance are what run out — not the request count.

Two caveats on those numbers, both from the same page: the request counts assume a typical agent turn of ~800 fresh input tokens, ~50,000 cache-read tokens and 125–200 output tokens, so a run that carries a large repo context drains the allowance faster; and DeepSeek is billed by time of day, with peak hours priced higher (01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC, Mon–Fri). Command Code states that allowances can change at any time — [the pricing page](https://commandcode.ai/docs/resources/pricing-limits) is authoritative, and the figures above are what it said on 2026-09-19.

### Subscribing

1. Sign in at [commandcode.ai](https://commandcode.ai/) and open [Pricing](https://commandcode.ai/pricing), or Studio → Billing.
2. Choose **GOAT** and check out. Card payments run through Stripe; **Alipay is supported** on the USD-denominated plans and sets up automatic renewal, which is worth knowing before the first invoice. UnionPay is not listed.
3. In Studio, open **API keys → Generate**. The key looks like `user_…`, not `sk-…`.
4. Hand it to dsh. Settings → Models takes a provider interactively; by file, add a route to `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   llm-pi-ai:
     providers:
       command-code-goat:
         apiKeyEnv: COMMAND_CODE_GOAT_API_KEY
         api: openai-completions
         baseURL: https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1
         models:
           - id: deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash
             contextWindow: 1000000
             input: ["text", "image"]
   ```

   Keep the key itself out of the file: put it in the environment, or in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` under `refs.COMMAND_CODE_GOAT_API_KEY`. Nothing else is needed — [Credentials](#credentials) is how the card finds this same route, which is why installing the plugin never asks for a key.

### Before you subscribe

- **Go (`$1`) has no API access.** All four quota endpoints answer 404, which the plugin reports as "this plan has no API access" rather than as an error it can retry.
- **The 5-hour and weekly windows start at your first request**, not at a calendar boundary, and switching plans clears both of them. The card shows the reset times the API reports instead of computing them from a period start.
- **One account per person.** The terms forbid sharing, reselling, or rotating keys across accounts, and a violation puts every account involved at risk of a permanent ban.
- **Other tiers, same card.** `$20` **Pro** (`$80` of credits) is the same shape with more headroom and `$100` / `$200` **Max** scale it again. The `$15` **Provider** plan is metered API access with no rolling windows, so the card shows the balance and no window rows.

## Credentials

The API key never reaches the browser. The host resolves it in this order and reports which source won:

1. An explicitly passed key (the CLI's `--key`).
2. **Discovered from your own `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`** — any provider route whose `baseURL` points at `commandcode.ai`. The plugin reads that route's literal `apiKey` or its `apiKeyEnv`, then resolves the name through the environment and `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`. The provider's host is kept (a staging host or proxy works), but only its origin: the quota endpoints live at the host root, not under the provider's `/provider/v1` path.
3. Environment variables: `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`, `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY`, `CMD_API_KEY`, then **any** variable whose name contains `commandcode`.
4. Those same names inside `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (`refs.<NAME>`).
5. `~/.commandcode/auth.json`, the official `command-code` CLI's login state.

Step 2 is what makes this work for other people: it follows **your** provider configuration instead of hardcoding one naming convention.

<details>
<summary><strong>How it works</strong> — endpoints, seams, and the one that bit us</summary>

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Sidebar card<br/>(browser half)"] -->|"POST /api/cc-quota/report<br/>same origin, session cookie"| B["Host half<br/>(15 s cache + disk snapshot)"]
  B -->|"four read-only GETs, in parallel"| C["Command Code API<br/>/alpha/*"]
```

| Endpoint | Used for |
|---|---|
| `/alpha/whoami` | Account name, org id |
| `/alpha/usage/summary` | Credits used this period, requests, success rate, tokens |
| `/alpha/billing/credits` | Remaining credits, the 5-hour and weekly windows |
| `/alpha/billing/subscriptions` | Plan id, status, billing-period start and end |

Each endpoint degrades on its own: one failure is recorded in the report's `failures`, is shown on the card as a muted line, and the rest still render. All four failing raises one error with the most specific code — including "this plan has no API access" when all four answer 404.

</details>

## Compatibility

The plugin depends on framework seams that are not a stable public API yet. Each is pinned to what `dsh 0.1.5-rc.1` actually exposes:

| Seam | Used for |
|---|---|
| `sidebar.footer.action` slot | The seat above Settings, in both sidebar widths |
| `ctx.slots.register({ name, id, order, inject }, Component)` | Contributing the card |
| `ctx.connection.rpc.call(channel, endpoint, payload, signal)` | The browser side of the request |
| `ctx.connection.fetch.register({ path, methods, requestBody, fetch })` | The host side of the route |
| `ctx.get('commands')` + `commands.register({ name, description, handler })` | The optional `/quota` command |
| `dsh.client` manifest + `exports["./client"]` | Client-bundle discovery, served at `/plugins/<id>/client.js` |

> **Why an exact Fetch route instead of `connection.rpc.handle`?** `rpc.handle` mounts its channel through `owner.webServer`, where `owner` is the Connection service's own context — which never injects `webServer`. Calling it from any other plugin throws `cannot get property "webServer" without inject`, whatever the caller injects. `connection.fetch.register` only writes the route table, works from any plugin fiber, and inherits the shared `/api` transport's Host/Origin fence and browser-session cookie.

If a future dsh release changes one of these, the plugin fails loudly at load rather than silently rendering nothing.

## Standalone CLI

The same data layer ships as a zero-dependency read-only CLI — useful on a headless machine, or for checking a second account:

```sh
node cli/cli.mjs              # render once
node cli/cli.mjs --watch 60   # refresh every 60 seconds
node cli/cli.mjs --json       # normalized report for scripts
node cli/cli.mjs --help
```

Shown with `--ascii`, and deliberately so: the default bars are drawn with full-height block glyphs, which sit flush against the text line beside them in many code fonts — in this very README the weekly bar merged with the 5-hour countdown above it. `#` and `-` are ordinary glyphs and travel everywhere. There are also no rule lines and no right-aligned columns, so every line stands on its own instead of depending on character-cell widths.

Flags: `--json`, `--watch [seconds]`, `--ascii`, `--color` / `--no-color`, `--base <url>`, `--timeout <ms>`, `--key <key>`.

The CLI's human-readable output is Chinese; `--json` is language-neutral and is the interface to script against. It follows the card's presentation rules — money on the monthly allowance only, no pace verdict and no burn-rate forecast (those remain in the JSON).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What it means |
|---|---|
| No card at all | This host has no Command Code provider configured, so the plugin stays invisible by design. Check Settings → Models. |
| The card shows an error | The card says what it can ("cannot reach Command Code", "the API key was rejected"); hover it for the full diagnostic text. |
| `/plugins/dsh-commandcode-quota/client.js` returns 404 | The client bundle was not composed. Check that `package.json` declares `dsh.client.platform === "web"` and `exports["./client"]`. |
| A change to `client.js` did nothing | Reload the page — the bundle is read from disk per request. Changes to `index.js` or `quota.mjs` need a `dsh web` restart (Node caches modules). |
| Numbers are dimmed | The host answered with its last snapshot, or a refresh failed. Hover the card for the age of the reading; it corrects itself on the next refresh. |
| Everything reads `—` | The account reported no windows for that plan, or a read is still in flight. |
| The panel is empty after removing Command Code | Intended — the plugin does not show a snapshot for a provider you no longer have. |

## Privacy

- Your API key stays on the host. The browser never receives it; it only receives the normalized report over the same-origin `/api` transport, which is fenced to loopback and requires this process's browser-session cookie.
- The plugin talks only to your Command Code account's API. No telemetry, no analytics, no third-party endpoints.
- The only local file written is the last-report snapshot at `$DSH_HOME/dsh-commandcode-quota/last-report.json`. It holds the figures the card shows — never the key, and only a short digest of the key, used to check that the snapshot belongs to the account currently configured. Delete it any time; the plugin recreates it.
- Apart from that snapshot, every refresh is a live read of four read-only endpoints.

## Development

```sh
# 1. React is needed only by the component test and the preview page
mkdir .devdeps && cd .devdeps && npm init -y && npm install react@18 react-dom@18 && cd ..

# 2. Everything at once — 156 checks, one verdict, no network, no real credentials
node scripts/check.mjs            # release check: static + secret scan + every suite below
node scripts/verify.mjs           # add --live to also hit a real account
node scripts/verify.mjs --quiet   # one summary line per suite
```

```text
ok    quota   (discovery contract)            17 checks
ok    host    (route, cache, concurrency)     30 checks
ok    client  (rendering, boundaries)         58 checks
ok    dynamic (drift, resets, bad payloads)   33 checks
ok    cli     (arguments, exit codes)          3 checks
ok    audit   (credentials, host paths)
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `node scripts/check.mjs` | The release check: every JSON file parses, every `.js`/`.mjs` passes `node --check`, no credential or machine-specific path is committed, then every suite below |
| `node scripts/verify.mjs` | Every suite, one exit code. `--live` adds two suites that read a real account |
| `node scripts/audit.mjs` | Scans for credential-shaped or machine-specific content before committing |
| `node preview/latency.mjs` | Where the first paint's time goes: per-endpoint timings and the cold-start contrast |
| `node preview/build.mjs` | Renders the real `client.js` into a mock sidebar (light/dark, collapsed/expanded; `--with-snapshot` adds the restart state) for a headless screenshot — no `dsh` restart needed |
| `node preview/e2e-live.mjs` | One live read: prints the `/quota` text and asserts `used + remaining = cap` |
| `node preview/e2e-watch.mjs 6 20` | Samples a live account six times and asserts the numbers stay consistent while they move |

Determinism is checked by repetition, not by reading the code: `for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do node scripts/verify.mjs --quiet; done` should print the same total every time.

## Known limitations

- **Polling, not push.** The panel refreshes every 60 seconds (15 seconds while a window is approaching its cap, and never once a window is spent), with a 15-second host cache on top. Credit changes can lag by up to a minute.
- **No per-model allowance breakdown.** Command Code allocates a per-model share of the monthly budget, but the `/alpha` endpoints do not expose that table, so the card reports the total only.
- **No history.** Every read is a live snapshot; nothing is stored except the one cached report.
- **Command Code only.** This does not replace DSH's own local token statistics (`$DSH_HOME/dsh-usage/`).
- **Framework seams.** See [Compatibility](#compatibility) — a future dsh release will need a look.

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before opening a PR, run `node scripts/check.mjs` — it should be green, and a new behaviour should come with a check that would have failed before it.
